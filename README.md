# Music Library Extractor for MacOS
This app offers a simple tool for going over the data from your Music library on MacOS, wiht the option to generate back ups of any and all fields of data in CSV format.

The conversion of the data to CSV is done with the help of the [**CodableCSV** library](https://github.com/dehesa/CodableCSV). 

## To export the library: 
1. Click on "**Extract Library**" on the Home tab.
2. On the Export tab, select from the available fields of data what to include on the csv file (at least one field, _title_ selected by default), and add a name to it.
3. Finally click on "**Export as .csv**". The created file will be waiting under "**/Downloads/Results**"
